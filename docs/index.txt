#########################

``django-email-confirmation`` keeps track of multiple e-email addresses for
users.  It provides models, forms, and views to allow users to see their
current list of e-email addresses, confirm any that are unconfirmed, and
mark one of the confirmed addresses as their primary e-mail address. Their
primary e-mail address is synced with the ``email`` field of the
``django.contrib.auth`` ``User`` model.

A user can have zero or more e-mail addresses linked to them. When a user
adds a new e-mail address, they are e-mailed with a link they must click on
to confirm that the e-mail address is theirs.  A confirmation e-mail can be
resent at any time.

The source contains a working project that shows all the features of the app
as well as providing useful code for your own project (although Pinax is a
more comprehensive example of how to use django-email-confirmation).

This code is based in part on django-registration and can be used alongside
it or as a replacement for it where your requirements are different.
